 * # `gencad` Crate
 *
 * A library for parsing GenCAD files.
 *
 * This crate provides a full pipeline for working with GenCAD files:
 *
 * 1. [parser]: Converts the decoded bytes into structured data.
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 *
 * ```no_run
 * use std::fs::File;
 * use std::io::BufReader;
 *
 * use gencad::parser::ParsedGencadFile;
 *
 * fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
 *     // Open the file
 *     let file = File::open("example.cad")?;
 *     let reader = BufReader::new(file);
 *
 *     // Parse the file
 *     let parsed = ParsedGencadFile::new(reader)?;
 *
 *     // Access parsed data
 *     for section in parsed.sections {
 *         println!("{:?}", section);
 *     }
 *
 *     Ok(())
 * }
 * ```
